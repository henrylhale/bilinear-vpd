        "the evidence provided below."
    )
    md.p(
        "In PD, each weight matrix of a network is decomposed into C rank-1 parts, "
        'called "subcomponents", where C is usually greater than the rank '
        "of the weight matrix. These are parameterised as U \u2022 V (dimensions `d_out` \u00d7 "
        "`d_in`). Each subcomponent represents a one-dimensional slice of the computation the "
        "weight matrix performs."

    md.bullets(
        [
            "Faithfulness: the C rank-1 subcomponent matrices must sum to the original weight "
            "matrix - this should be a direct factorisation of the original weight matrix.",
            "Minimality / Simplicity: For a given datapoint, as few subcomponents as possible "
            "should be necessary for the network. Alternatively - as many subcomponents as "
            "possible should be ablatable",
            "Reconstruction: The network should nonetheless reproduce the behaviour of the "
            "target network.",
        ]

    md.p(
        'In order to facilitate this, we train a small auxiliary "Causal Importance Network" '
        "which produces a mask of Causal Importance values in (0, 1) for each datapoint/token. "
        "The minimality/simplicity loss above incentivizes this mask to be sparse."
    )

    # --- CI and activation explanation ---
    md.p("At each token position, each component has 2 values:")
    md.numbered(
        [
            "**Causal Importance (CI):** The primary measure of component activity. CI is how "
            "causally important this component is for the model's output at this token \u2014 i.e. "
            'how much would ablating it change the output. CI is the basis for "firing": a '
            "component fires when its CI exceeds a threshold. **When interpreting a component, CI "
            "is the signal you should weight most heavily.**",
            "**Inner Activation (act):** The dot product of the input with the component's read "
            "direction (`x @ V`), scaled by the write direction norm. This measures how much the "
            "input aligns with what the component reads, regardless of whether that alignment "
            "matters for the output.",
        ]
    )
    md.p(
        "These two values are correlated but meaningfully different. A large inner activation "
        "with low CI means the input happens to align with the component's read direction, but "
        "the component's contribution isn't needed at this token. **When CI and act diverge, "
        "trust CI.** A position with high CI and low act can be genuinely important; a position "
        "with low CI and high act suggests that the component would produce an output here but "
        "that it's not necessary. When building your interpretation, weight "

        'does not inherently mean excitation and "negative" does not inherently mean '
        "suppression. However, **relative sign within a component is meaningful**: tokens with "
        "positive act and tokens with negative act produce opposite contributions to the "
        "output. So if you notice examples splitting into a positive-act cluster and a "
        "negative-act cluster, that split is real and likely reflects two distinct roles (e.g. "
        "one token class activates positively, another negatively). You should describe both "
        'clusters if they exist, but do not assign meaning to which cluster is "positive" vs '
        '"negative" \u2014 only that they are opposite.'
