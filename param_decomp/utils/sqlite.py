"""SQLite connection helpers for NFS-mounted databases.

Two environments exist in this codebase:

1. **NFS databases** (harvest, autointerp, graph_interp, dataset_attributions):
   - Live at PARAM_DECOMP_OUT_DIR on shared NFS mount
   - WAL mode MUST NOT be used — it requires POSIX advisory locking which
     NFS doesn't support reliably, causing "database is locked" errors
   - Readonly uses ?immutable=1 (no lock files created at all)
   - Write mode uses default DELETE journal

2. **App database** (prompt_attr.db):
   - Lives at PARAM_DECOMP_OUT_DIR/app/ on NFS (shared across team)
   - Uses DELETE journal mode with fcntl.flock write locking
   - Managed by PromptAttrDB in param_decomp/app/backend/database.py
